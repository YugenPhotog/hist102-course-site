# Lecture 3 — Red Summer, Sacco–Vanzetti, and the Crisis of American Democracy (1919–1927)

## Lecture Purpose

This lecture explains how World War I ends politically inside the United States. Victory abroad is followed by fear at home. Racial violence, labor unrest, and anti-radical repression converge into a crisis over who belongs in American democracy and under what conditions dissent is permitted.

Rather than treating Red Summer, the Red Scare, and the Sacco–Vanzetti case as separate episodes, this lecture presents them as interconnected responses to trauma, disillusionment, and unmet democratic expectations.

## I. The Postwar Moment: Victory Without Stability

The United States emerges from World War I powerful but insecure.

- Returning soldiers face inflation, job shortages, and broken promises  
- Wartime controls disappear unevenly, creating economic volatility  
- The influenza pandemic has recently killed more Americans than the war itself  
- Revolution in Russia intensifies fear of global instability  

Key framing idea:  
The war ends, but emergency thinking does not.

The conditions that produced wartime mobilization now produce suspicion and fear.

## II. The Rise of the American Left

Before repression comes radical hope.

- Wartime labor shortages increase worker leverage  
- Union membership grows  
- Socialist, anarchist, and radical labor movements gain visibility  
- Strikes become widespread and sometimes multiracial  

Radical ideas are not marginal fantasies. They respond to real conditions: inequality, exploitation, and the promise that democracy should extend into economic life.

Dissent during and after the war reframes democracy as something unfinished rather than achieved.

## III. Red Summer (1919): Race, Violence, and Citizenship

The year 1919 witnesses a nationwide wave of racial violence.

- Riots erupt in Northern, Midwestern, and Southern cities  
- Black veterans assert claims to full citizenship  
- White mobs enforce racial hierarchy through violence  
- Local authorities often side with attackers or fail to intervene  

Red Summer is not random chaos. It is counter-revolutionary violence aimed at policing the boundaries of democracy.

Race and radicalism increasingly merge as perceived threats.

## IV. The Red Scare: Fear as Governance

Political leaders respond to unrest by redefining dissent as danger.

- Radicalism is framed as foreign infection  
- Immigration status becomes evidence of disloyalty  
- Surveillance and raids expand rapidly  
- Deportation replaces debate  

The Red Scare normalizes the idea that democracy must be defended by limiting participation.

Fear becomes policy.

## V. The Sacco–Vanzetti Case: Justice on Trial

The arrest and trial of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti crystallize postwar anxieties.

- Both men are Italian immigrants and self-identified anarchists  
- Evidence is weak, contradictory, and circumstantial  
- Courtroom rhetoric emphasizes beliefs and identity  
- Public opinion is sharply divided  

The case becomes a global symbol of American justice under strain.

What is on trial is not only two defendants, but whether political belief and immigrant status override due process.

---

## VI. Culture, Protest, and Dissent

Writers, artists, and intellectuals respond forcefully.

- Public letters, protests, and demonstrations spread internationally  
- Cultural figures treat the case as evidence of democratic failure  
- Artistic and literary protest becomes a substitute for political access  

Modernist disillusionment now acquires explicit political form.

Culture becomes a site of resistance when institutions close ranks.

---

## VII. Consequences and Closure

The execution of Sacco and Vanzetti in 1927 marks a grim endpoint.

- The American Left survives but is fractured and marginalized  
- Surveillance and repression become normalized  
- Racial violence reinforces structural inequality  
- Democracy narrows under the language of security  

The postwar crisis resolves not through reconciliation, but through exclusion.

---

## Final Takeaway

World War I does not end with peace at home. It ends with boundaries redrawn tighter around race, ideology, and belonging.

The Red Summer, the Red Scare, and the Sacco–Vanzetti case reveal a democracy struggling to survive its own contradictions in the aftermath of total war and mass trauma.
