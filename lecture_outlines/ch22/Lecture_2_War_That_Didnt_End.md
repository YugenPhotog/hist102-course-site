# Lecture 2 — The War That Didn’t End: Roosevelt and the Moral Mechanics of Occupation

## Lecture Purpose
This lecture examines what happened after the Spanish–American War formally ended. While Americans celebrated victory in 1898, the United States immediately faced the challenge of governing people who did not want American rule—especially in the Philippines. The focus here is on colonialism, occupation, and the moral reasoning used to justify sustained coercion.

## Lecture Prep — Suggested Reading List

### Required (short, high-impact)
- **Primary-source excerpt:** Emilio Aguinaldo, selected proclamations or statements (1898–1899), focusing on expectations of independence.  
- **U.S. Army or government source:** A short excerpt using the language of “pacification,” “order,” or “stability” in the Philippines.

### Recommended (for enrichment or advanced students)
- **Mark Twain, “To the Person Sitting in Darkness” (1901)** — satire exposing the moral contradictions of American imperialism.  
- **Paul A. Kramer, _The Blood of Government_** — short excerpt or summary on race, violence, and empire in the Philippines.  
- **Brief Anti-Imperialist League document** — resolution or pamphlet excerpt critiquing colonial rule.

> **Instructor note:** The goal of the prep is to foreground *competing moral frameworks*: liberation versus order, consent versus tutelage. Students should arrive ready to recognize imperial language and its justifications.

## I. Framing the Problem: When Victory Creates Responsibility
**Key claim:** Wars do not end when treaties are signed; they end only when questions of sovereignty, legitimacy, and consent are resolved.

- Americans expected celebration, not administration.
- Victory over Spain raised new questions:
  - Who governs former Spanish colonies?
  - On what authority?
  - For how long?
- The United States now faced empire without preparation.

---

## II. The Philippines Before the United States
**Key idea:** The Philippines did not enter history in 1898.

- Filipino revolutionaries had fought Spanish rule for decades.
- Leaders such as Emilio Aguinaldo expected independence.
- From the Filipino perspective:
  - Spain exits,
  - the United States arrives,
  - sovereignty remains unresolved.

**Conceptual payoff:** Conflict emerges from competing assumptions, not confusion.

---

## III. From Ally to Enemy: The Breakdown of Expectations
**Key claim:** The Philippine-American War begins with incompatible visions of freedom.

- American assumptions:
  - Filipinos were not ready for self-rule.
  - U.S. control would be temporary and benevolent.
- Filipino assumptions:
  - Independence would follow Spain’s defeat.
- Ambiguous sovereignty creates conditions for violence.

---

## IV. The Philippine-American War as a Colonial War
**Key reframing:** This conflict (1899–1902) is a colonial war of occupation, not an extension of the Spanish–American War.

- Rapid shift to guerrilla warfare.
- U.S. counterinsurgency tactics:
  - village destruction,
  - population relocation,
  - food denial.
- Emergence of imperial language:
  - “pacification”
  - “order”
  - “stability”

**Teaching point:** Calm language often masks coercive violence.

---

## V. Race, Civilization, and Moral Justification
**Key claim:** Racial hierarchy shaped moral reasoning.

- Filipinos were commonly described using racialized stereotypes.
- Racial assumptions lowered thresholds for acceptable violence.
- Logic of “civilization”:
  - force now,
  - freedom later.

This framework was persuasive to many Americans, not merely cynical.

---

## VI. Roosevelt’s Position: “Order First” Imperialism
**Why Roosevelt matters:** He articulated the moral logic of occupation clearly.

- Public defender of the Philippine War.
- Belief that liberty requires order.
- Force framed as regrettable but necessary.
- Resistance treated as criminal rather than political.

**Analytical framing:** Roosevelt exemplifies liberal imperialism.

---

## VII. The Anti-Imperialist Challenge
**Key idea:** Empire was contested at home.

- Anti-Imperialist League included politicians, reformers, writers, and veterans.
- Core argument:
  - empire violates republican principles,
  - governing without consent corrupts democracy.
- Mark Twain’s satire highlights moral contradiction and rhetorical self-deception.

---

## VIII. Synthesis: What Occupation Reveals About Empire
**Explicit takeaway:**

- Empire requires sustained coercion.
- Moral language does not eliminate violence.
- Democratic states can practice colonial rule.
- Wars for liberation can become wars for control.

**Transition to Lecture 3:**  
Once empire is accepted, how does a nation make that power permanent?

---

## Optional In-Class Activity
### “Order vs. Liberty” Stress Test
Students consider:
- Can liberty be postponed?
- Who decides when order is sufficient?
- How long does “temporary” rule usually last?

**Purpose:** To reveal how empire reshapes political time itself.
