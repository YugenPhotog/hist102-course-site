# American Historiography: How Historians Rewrote America

*A Lecture on the History of History*

*Day 3 of 3: Historiography in the American Tradition*

\[Estimated delivery time: 50-55 minutes]

## OPENING: Connecting to Our Framework

Good morning, everyone. Today we're going to do something a little different. We're not going to talk about what happened in American history—at least, not directly. Instead, we're going to talk about how American history has been written, interpreted, and constantly rewritten over the past century and a half.

Over the last two class sessions, we've built a toolkit for analyzing historical writing. We defined history as an argument about the past. We examined conceptual frameworks—linear and progressive models, the Rational Human Model, determinism, Great Man Theory. We explored how ideology distorts historical interpretation through the Procrustean Bed: forcing facts to fit predetermined conclusions, leaving out pertinent data, overemphasizing others.

Today, we're going to apply that toolkit. We're going to watch these concepts in action as we trace how American historians have told—and retold—the story of America.

Now, here's the uncomfortable truth that this lecture will make clear: historians do not simply 'discover' the past like archaeologists brushing dust off an artifact. They select. They interpret. They organize. And they do all of this based on the concerns, the anxieties, and the blind spots of their own era.

What this means—and I want you to sit with this for a moment—is that the story of America that you learned in high school was not simply 'what happened.' It was a story that reflected choices. Someone decided what to emphasize and what to leave out. Someone decided who counted as a historical actor and who didn't. Someone decided what questions were worth asking.

Over the next hour or so, we're going to trace this arc from the nineteenth century, when history first became a professional academic discipline, all the way to modern critiques that ask us to think about whose voices have been silenced and whose power has been served by the stories we tell about ourselves.

As we examine each historian, I want you to ask yourself: What is their conceptual framework? What do they see as the engine of change in history? What ideology shapes their interpretation? What do they emphasize, and what do they minimize or leave out?

Ready? Let's begin with the man who tried to turn history into a science.

## Herbert Baxter Adams: The Professionalization of History

In the 1870s and 1880s, Herbert Baxter Adams did something transformative at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. He took what had been the province of gentlemen amateurs—clergymen, lawyers, wealthy collectors—and turned it into a rigorous academic discipline.

Adams had studied in Germany, where he encountered the seminar model of graduate education. In German universities, young scholars gathered around a professor to engage in collective research, working directly with primary sources—original documents, manuscripts, the raw materials of history. Adams brought this model back to America and planted it at Johns Hopkins, where it would grow into the graduate programs we still have today.

He helped found the American Historical Association in 1884 and became the first secretary, serving as executive secretary from 1884 to 1900. He trained a generation of scholars. He helped establish professional journals and standards for historical research. In many ways, modern academic history begins with him.

But—and this is a significant 'but'—Adams also championed something called the Teutonic Germ Theory of political institutions. I know that name sounds strange, so let me explain.

Adams believed that American democratic institutions—our town meetings, our representative government, our commitment to individual liberty—could be traced back, like seeds germinating from a common source, to the tribal councils of ancient Germanic peoples in the forests of northern Europe. American democracy, in this view, didn't develop in America at all. It was inherited. It was racial. It was Anglo-Saxon.

Now, to be fair to Adams, he was working within the scientific frameworks of his era, when theories of racial development were considered cutting-edge scholarship. But what the Germ Theory did, in practice, was provide an academic foundation for Anglo-Saxon supremacy. It suggested that certain races were simply better suited for self-government than others—that democracy was in the blood of some peoples and not others.

***Historiographical Analysis: Adams***

Let's pause and analyze Adams using our framework from the first two lectures.

**What is Adams's conceptual framework?** He's working within a linear, evolutionary model—institutions develop over time from ancient seeds. But notice: he's also a determinist. The engine of change in his model isn't human choice or rational action; it's biological inheritance. Democracy doesn't emerge from decisions people make; it's transmitted through racial lineage.

**What ideology is at work?** This is nationalism in its most troubling form—not just celebrating a nation, but grounding national identity in racial characteristics. Adams's scholarship provided academic legitimacy for the idea that American democracy belonged to Anglo-Saxons and couldn't be successfully adopted by others.

This is a perfect example of historiography in action. A professional historian, working with the best methods available to him, produced scholarship that reflected—and reinforced—the prejudices of his age. Adams gave academic legitimacy to ideas that had profound political consequences.

Remember this as we proceed: professional credentials and rigorous methods do not automatically protect against ideological distortion.

## Frederick Jackson Turner: The Frontier Thesis

One of Adams's students was a young man from Wisconsin named Frederick Jackson Turner, and in 1893, Turner did something remarkable: he broke away from his teacher's European-focused interpretation and offered an entirely different explanation for American democracy.

Here we see historiographical revision happening in real time—a new generation writing its own history, asking new questions from a new vantage point. Remember our principle from Day One: each generation writes their own history because priorities change and new questions emerge. Turner's break from Adams illustrates this perfectly.

The occasion was the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago—that magnificent fair celebrating the four hundredth anniversary of Columbus's voyage. Turner presented a paper titled 'The Significance of the Frontier in American History,' and it would become arguably the most influential single essay ever written in American historical scholarship.

Turner's argument was elegant and bold: American character wasn't shaped in European forests thousands of years ago. It was shaped here, on the American frontier, in the continuous encounter between settlers and wilderness.

According to Turner, the frontier was a great leveler. When families moved west into unsettled territory, they left behind the rigid social hierarchies of the East. They had to rely on themselves. They had to cooperate with their neighbors. They had to adapt and innovate. Out of this crucible emerged the defining characteristics of the American people: individualism, self-reliance, democracy, and a restless energy that always looked toward the horizon.

Turner noted that the 1890 Census had declared the frontier 'closed'—there was no longer a continuous line of unsettled territory moving westward. This, he suggested, marked the end of an era. If the frontier had made Americans who they were, what would happen now that it was gone?

The Frontier Thesis became enormously influential. For decades, it was the dominant interpretation of American history. You can still see its echoes in how Americans talk about themselves—that mythology of rugged individualism, of the self-made pioneer, of endless possibility just over the next ridge.

But there's something conspicuously absent from Turner's story. Can anyone guess what it might be?

That's right: the people who were already there.

Turner's 'wilderness' was, of course, not empty. It was home to hundreds of Native American nations with their own histories, their own governments, their own complex relationships with the land. The 'frontier' that Turner celebrated was, from another perspective, a centuries-long campaign of conquest, displacement, and often extermination.

Turner didn't hide this exactly—he occasionally mentioned 'Indian fighting'—but it wasn't central to his story. The violence was background noise, not the main event. And that choice, that decision about what to emphasize and what to minimize, tells us as much about the 1890s as it does about the frontier itself.

***Historiographical Analysis: Turner***

Let's analyze Turner the way we learned to analyze any historical argument.

**What is Turner's conceptual framework?** He's clearly working within a linear, evolutionary, progressive model—American character develops through successive stages of frontier encounter, each stage producing more democracy, more individualism, more 'American-ness.' This is history as progress.

**What is his engine of change?** This is where Turner gets interesting. Is this the Rational Human Model or Determinism? Actually, it's both. Settlers exercise agency—they make choices, adapt, innovate. But the environment shapes them almost mechanically. The frontier makes Americans democratic whether they consciously intend it or not. This is environmental determinism: material conditions shaping character and consciousness. Notice the parallel to Marxism's claim that material conditions shape ideology.

**What ideology is at work?** Turner's thesis is nationalist history in its classic form. Let's check the boxes from our Day Two discussion:

Does it create an origin myth for 'American-ness'? Yes—the frontier as the crucible of national character.

Does it engage in hero-building? Yes—the collective pioneer as national hero.

Does it glorify the nation-state? Yes—American democracy as the triumphant product of this process.

Does it distort by slanting? Absolutely. This is the Procrustean Bed in action: the Native presence doesn't fit the story of empty wilderness creating democracy, so it gets stretched, cut, and minimized to background noise.

**What was Turner's vantage point?** He's writing in 1893, at the Columbian Exposition—a massive celebration of American progress and civilization. The Census just declared the frontier closed. There's anxiety about immigration, about urbanization, about whether the national character can survive without its crucible. Turner's argument isn't just about the past; it's an intervention in 1890s debates about American identity and future.

## William A. Dunning: The Tragic Story of Reconstruction

Now we come to a more troubling chapter in the history of American historiography—one that demonstrates how professional scholarship can do real damage when it serves particular political agendas.

William A. Dunning was a historian at Columbia University in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries who established what became known as the Dunning School of Reconstruction history. His students and followers dominated the academic study of the post-Civil War period for nearly half a century.

The story the Dunning School told went something like this: Reconstruction was a tragic mistake. After the Civil War, vindictive Northern Republicans, motivated by partisan greed, imposed military rule on the defeated South. They enfranchised newly freed Black men who were—according to this narrative—'unfit' for citizenship. Corrupt 'carpetbaggers' from the North and 'scalawags' from the South plundered state treasuries while ignorant Black legislators made a mockery of democratic government.

In this telling, the 'Redemption' of the South—when white supremacist Democrats regained power through violence and voter suppression—was not a betrayal of democracy but a restoration of it. The Ku Klux Klan, while perhaps a bit excessive in its methods, was understandable as a response to the outrages of Black political participation.

I want to be very clear about what the Dunning School accomplished: it provided academic justification for Jim Crow. The Dunning School leaned on what they called "Negro Incapacity"—the claim that Black people were naïve, corrupt, and incompetent. If this were true, then all America should be grateful that the KKK and similar groups "redeemed" the South—"Redemption" being their term, not ours, a word choice that framed the violent overthrow of democratically elected governments as a restoration rather than a destruction. We now see it for the racist nonsense that it was. But this wasn't fringe pseudo-scholarship. This was mainstream professional history, taught at elite universities, published in prestigious journals, written in measured academic prose.

The Dunning interpretation became so dominant that it shaped popular culture. If you've ever seen Birth of a Nation, D.W. Griffith's 1915 film that portrays the Klan as heroes and depicts Black politicians as buffoons and predators—that's Dunning School history translated to celluloid. President Woodrow Wilson screened it at the White House and allegedly called it 'history written with lightning.'

***Historiographical Analysis: Dunning***

Remember our definition of ideology from Day Two: a system of ideas that aspires both to explain the world and to change it. The Dunning School wasn't just explaining Reconstruction—it was justifying Jim Crow in the present. The ideology at work here is racism: the belief that Black people were inherently inferior and incapable of self-governance. That ideological commitment came first; the historical interpretation followed. This is ideology distorting history exactly as we discussed: forcing facts to mesh with predetermined conclusions, leaving out pertinent data (like Black political achievements), overemphasizing others (like corruption, which existed but was hardly unique to Reconstruction governments). The Dunning School didn't discover that Reconstruction failed—they started from the racist premise that it had to fail, and then assembled evidence accordingly.

This is perhaps the starkest example we'll see today of how historiography is never neutral. The Dunning School wasn't just telling a story about the past; it was providing intellectual cover for the present—for the disenfranchisement, the segregation, and the terror that Black Americans experienced in the early twentieth century.

## W.E.B. Du Bois: The Revisionist Breakthrough

Which brings us to one of the most important—and for decades, one of the most ignored—works of American historical scholarship ever written.

In 1935, W.E.B. Du Bois published Black Reconstruction in America, a massive, meticulously researched work that systematically dismantled everything the Dunning School had built.

Du Bois was already a towering figure: the first African American to earn a Ph.D. from Harvard, a founder of the NAACP, author of The Souls of Black Folk. But with Black Reconstruction, he took on the historical profession itself.

His argument was radical for its time—though it seems obvious now. Reconstruction, Du Bois contended, was not a tragic failure but a revolutionary experiment in interracial democracy. Black legislators weren't ignorant buffoons; they established public school systems, wrote progressive constitutions, and expanded democratic participation. The failure of Reconstruction wasn't caused by Black political involvement—it was caused by the violent terrorist campaigns that overthrew democratically elected governments.

Du Bois also introduced a concept that would prove enormously influential: the 'general strike' of enslaved people. He argued that during the Civil War, enslaved men and women didn't simply wait to be freed. They acted. They fled to Union lines. They provided intelligence to Federal forces. They sabotaged Confederate operations. They made themselves, through their own initiative, a crucial factor in Union victory.



***Historiographical Analysis: Du Bois***

**What is Du Bois's engine of change?** This is crucial: Du Bois locates historical agency in the collective action of the oppressed. The 'general strike' concept transforms enslaved people from passive victims waiting for white saviors into agents of their own liberation. They helped win the war. They demanded citizenship. They built institutions. And they did all of this in the face of unimaginable violence.

This represents a fundamental shift in how we understand who makes history. Compare this to Great Man Theory: Du Bois acknowledges influential individuals (politicians, organizers, intellectuals), but he rejects “Great Man” causation. His point is that no individual “makes” Reconstruction; individuals matter because they channel, organize, and guide the political power generated by the Black masses. 



Now, here's the painful part: Black Reconstruction was largely ignored by the white historical profession when it first appeared. It would take decades—until the Civil Rights Movement forced a reckoning with American racism—for Du Bois's interpretation to become mainstream. Today, Black Reconstruction is recognized as a masterpiece, the foundation of modern scholarship on the period.



But for thirty years, it sat on library shelves while the Dunning School interpretation remained dominant. That delay—that thirty years of professional dismissal—tells us something important about who gets to be heard in the academy and who gets ignored. The profession itself can function as an ideological gatekeeper, determining which arguments gain traction and which are marginalized.



Luckily, the story of Reconstruction does not end there. Du Bois was rediscovered by historians during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, which forced a major rethinking of Black agency and the meaning of Reconstruction. That shift culminated in Eric Foner’s brilliant synthesis, Reconstruction: America’s Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877 (1988), which—building on Du Bois—systematically dismantles the core claims of the Dunning School.  We will discuss Foner's work in more depth in our Reconstruction lectures. 

## 

## Pause for Reflection: Engines of Change

Let's pause here and synthesize what we've seen. We've now encountered multiple answers to the question we raised on Day One: what is the engine of change in history?

**Adams:** Racial inheritance (biological determinism)

**Turner:** Environmental encounter (environmental determinism combined with human agency)

**Dunning:** The presence or absence of 'fit' leaders (inverted Great Man Theory)

**Du Bois:** Collective agency of the oppressed



Obviously, the story of American Historians does not end here.   We will discuss Carl Becker, Charles A Bead, the Consensus School, and other contemporary historians in Part 2.  For now lets continue this theme of how ideology often shapes or distorts how history is told.  And no one does this better than Howard Zinn. 

## 

## Howard Zinn: History as Political Weapon



Howard Zinn may not have been a card-carrying member of the Communist Party, but he may as well have been.   His actions were no different than any Communist Party member in the 1940s though the 1960s.  He was deeply involved in CPUSA-dominated groups, such as teaching Marxism classes at Communist Party headquarters in Brooklyn, attending meetings regularly (per informants), and exercised leadership roles in Communist fronts like the American Labor Party, American Veterans Committee, and the International Workers Order.



In 1980, Zinn published A People's History of the United States, and it became a phenomenon—one of the best-selling history books ever written. And unfortunately, it has shaped how millions of Americans understand their own past.

This book told the American story from the perspective of the oppressed, otherwise known as History from Below.  In his telling, America is a story of class-conflict: between the oppressed and the oppressors. Columbus through the eyes of the Arawak. The Constitution through the eyes of slaves and workers. Westward expansion through the eyes of the Cherokee on the Trail of Tears. Industrialization through the eyes of the laborers, not the robber barons.

Zinn represented the 'New Left' historiography that emerged from the social movements of the 1960s and 70s. These historians saw their work not as detached scholarship but as political intervention. If traditional history had been guided by nationalism by celebrating national myths and ignoring victims, then Marxist history should expose those myths and recover those victims.



***Historiographical Analysis: Zinn***

**What's Zinn's engine of change?**   He emphasized class conflict as the primary driver of societal change, framing American history as a struggle between oppressors (elites, capitalists) and the oppressed (workers, minorities, and other subaltern groups). This aligns closely with Karl Marx's core ideas of inevitable class warfare between the bourgeoisie (capital-owning class) and the proletariat (working class), culminating in a revolutionary overthrow to establish communism. So for Zinn the agent of change is class conflict, and what he does in his books is to expose class-conflict by highlighting the oppression of the subaltern (marginalized or  minority groups).



**What ideology is at work?** Zinn was a Marxist ideologue. And like all ideological history, he distorts history by slanting.  He selected evidence to support his predetermined conclusions; he sacrificed nuance for polemic; and so he ends up replacing one bias with another rather than transcending bias altogether.  Zinn used history as a weapon in his Marxist ideological quiver.  When asked what the purpose of writing A People's History Zinn remarked that if Americans knew the "truth" of the American past, no one would enlist in the army to defend her.  His ultimate agenda is obvious: the destruction of America and its capitalist economy.





Lets be clear.  I have no problem teaching "history from below." It obviously is an important part of the American story and Americans need to know it.  I teach the ethnic cleansing and genocide of the American Indians; I spend a large amount of time discussing the evils of slavery; I don't forget to cover the struggles of laborers during Antebellum industrialization.  If Zinn was simply offering his work as a corrective or revision to previous nationalist histories I would have no critique.  But this is not what he is doing.  By ignoring other aspects of American history -- remember the Procrustian bed - he is making the statement that this IS the truth of American history.  And it simply is not.  It is American history through the filter of Marxism in the same way that Dunning is American history through the filter of racism.  Ideology blinds the historian to any other evidence or interpretation.  







## CONCLUSION: History as Argument

So where does this leave us?

We've traveled from Herbert Baxter Adams's 'germs' sprouting in ancient Germanic forests, through Frederick Jackson Turner's frontier forge of democracy, through the Dunning School's racist apologetics and Du Bois's revolutionary revision, through Beard's economic reductionism. In part 2 I will discuss the Consensus historians' Cold War synthesis, through the Ideological Turn's recovery of republican thought, through Becker's epistemological humility and Zinn's political commitment.

What connects all of these interpretations, despite their differences, is this: history is not a neutral transcript of what happened. History is an argument. It is a story constructed by particular people, for particular purposes, using particular frameworks to make sense of evidence.

This is what we mean by “history is an argument about the past.” Now you've seen how that argument has changed over a century and a half—and why it changes.

This doesn't mean that history is just opinion, or that all interpretations are equally valid. The evidence matters. The methods matter. Professional training and peer review matter. But within those constraints, historians make choices—about what questions to ask, about whose perspectives to privilege, about what counts as significant.

To study history, then, is not simply to learn 'what happened.' It is to study the frameworks, the ideologies, and the theories that allow us to make sense of the evidence. It is to understand that the stories we tell about the past shape how we understand the present and what we imagine as possible for the future.

When you encounter a historical claim—in a textbook, in a documentary, or more importantly in a political speech—I want you to ask:

Who is telling this story?

What are they emphasizing, and what are they leaving out?

Whose interests does this narrative serve?

What questions is it answering, and what questions is it not even asking?

These are the questions that historiography teaches us to ask. And they are, I would suggest, among the most important skills you can develop—not just for understanding the past, but for navigating the contested stories of our own moment.
