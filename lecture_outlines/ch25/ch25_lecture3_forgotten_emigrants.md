# Chapter 25 — Lecture 3
## Exit, Faith, and Catastrophe: The Forgotten Emigrants

### Lecture Purpose
This lecture globalizes the Great Depression and challenges American exceptionalism by examining Americans who emigrated to the Soviet Union during the 1930s.

---

## I. When Staying Stops Making Sense

Protest is not the only response to despair.
For some, exit appeared rational.

This lecture asks: what happens when belief in one’s society collapses?

---

## II. Americans Who Left

Thousands of Americans—engineers, workers, farmers—emigrated in search of:
- Employment
- Dignity
- Purpose

These were not ideological radicals, but people seeking survival.

---

## III. From Guests to Suspects

Once inside the Soviet system:
- Passports were confiscated
- Contracts became obligations
- Complaints became evidence

Foreign workers were reclassified as threats.

---

## IV. The Purges

During Stalin’s purges:
- Many American emigrants were arrested
- Others were imprisoned, executed, or erased
- Most disappeared from public memory

---

## V. Comparative Insight

Two systems failed differently:
- American capitalism produced abandonment
- Soviet socialism produced terror

Visibility marked the difference:
- One system documented suffering
- The other denied its existence

---

## Conclusion
The New Deal mattered not because it solved the Depression, but because it made failure survivable without terror.
