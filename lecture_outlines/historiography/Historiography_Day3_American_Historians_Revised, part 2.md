## Carl Becker: The Question of Objectivity

Now, running through all of these debates is a deeper question, one that the historian Carl Becker posed with particular clarity: Is historical objectivity even possible?

In his famous 1931 presidential address to the American Historical Association, titled 'Everyman His Own Historian,' Becker challenged the scientific pretensions of his profession. History, he argued, is not simply 'what happened'—it is a construction that exists in the historian's mind.

The past itself is gone. It cannot be recovered. What we have are traces—documents, artifacts, memories—and the historian must select from these traces, organize them into a coherent narrative, decide what matters and what doesn't. This process of selection is inevitably shaped by the historian's own concerns, by the questions that seem important in their own time.

Becker's insight was that every generation creates the history it needs. The past doesn't speak for itself; it answers only the questions we ask it. And the questions we ask are determined by our present circumstances.

***Connecting to Day One***

Remember when I said on Day One that history is an argument about the past? Becker is the historian who made that case most forcefully within the profession itself. He's providing the theoretical grounding for our entire approach in this unit.

This doesn't mean that all historical claims are equally valid, or that we can simply make up the past. The evidence constrains us; professional standards discipline us. But within those constraints, there is always interpretation. There is always choice. There is always a perspective.

Becker was asking us to be more humble about what history can achieve, and more honest about what historians actually do.

## Charles A. Beard: Following the Money

Let's shift gears now from questions of race to questions of class and economic interest. In 1913—the same era as the Dunning School but with very different concerns—Charles A. Beard published An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States, and it landed like a bomb in the historical profession.

Beard's thesis was startlingly simple: What if we stopped treating the Founding Fathers as demigods motivated by pure philosophical idealism, and instead asked a basic question—who benefited?

Beard went through the financial records. He examined the investments, the land holdings, the business interests of the men who wrote and ratified the Constitution. And he concluded that these were not disinterested statesmen sacrificing for the common good. They were, many of them, bondholders, creditors, and speculators who stood to gain directly from a strong central government that could pay its debts and protect commercial interests.

This was shocking. Remember, this was the Progressive Era—a time when Americans were increasingly skeptical of economic elites, of the robber barons who dominated industry and finance. Beard was suggesting that this skepticism should extend backward in time, to the very founding of the Republic.

***Historiographical Analysis: Beard***

Beard represented what historians call the Progressive School. These scholars saw American history not as a story of consensus and shared values, but as a series of conflicts between economic groups: farmers versus merchants, debtors versus creditors, workers versus capitalists.

**What's the critique of this approach?** Remember what we said about Marxism: it can distort by slanting, by overemphasizing economic factors. Subsequent scholars have challenged many of Beard's specific claims. His evidence was sometimes selective; his conclusions were sometimes overstated. Did the Founders have economic interests? Certainly. Were those interests the primary or sole motivation for the Constitution? That's much harder to prove.

But Beard's fundamental question—who benefits from particular historical arrangements?—remains essential. When you're reading any historical argument, including this lecture, it's worth asking: whose interests does this story serve?

## Consensus Historians: The Cold War Synthesis

After World War II, a new generation of historians emerged with a very different sensibility. The world had just witnessed the horrors of fascism and was now locked in an existential struggle with Soviet communism. In this context, the Progressive School's emphasis on conflict and class struggle started to look a little too... well... Marxist.

The Consensus historians of the 1950s flipped the script. Instead of asking what divided Americans, they asked what united them. And their answer was: quite a lot, actually.

Louis Hartz, in The Liberal Tradition in America (1955), argued that Americans had never experienced true feudalism, so they never developed genuine socialist or reactionary movements. American political culture was fundamentally Lockean—committed to individual rights, private property, and limited government—and this consensus was so deep that Americans couldn't even imagine genuine alternatives.

Daniel Boorstin, in works like The Genius of American Politics (1953), celebrated American pragmatism and anti-ideology. Americans didn't waste time on abstract philosophical systems; they got things done. This practical, non-ideological approach was precisely what made American democracy work.

***Historiographical Analysis: Consensus School***

Now, there's an obvious context for these interpretations: the Cold War. When the Soviet Union represented one ideological extreme, it was comforting to argue that America had avoided such extremism, that Americans had always been moderate, practical, consensus-seeking.

**What ideology is shaping these questions?** This is nationalism adapted to Cold War conditions. Notice what's happening: nationalist ideology is shaping what questions seem worth asking. In a Cold War context, emphasizing American conflict and class struggle feels dangerous—it sounds like the enemy's narrative. So Consensus historians ask different questions, questions that produce a more comforting national story. This isn't necessarily conscious distortion, but it's ideology at work nonetheless.

**What's the engine of change?** For Consensus historians, it's shared ideas and values—the liberal consensus itself. This is almost the opposite of Beard's materialism: ideas drive history, and Americans share fundamental ideas that transcend class or regional differences.

But not all Consensus historians were cheerleaders for American exceptionalism. Richard Hofstadter stands apart as what we might call an 'ironic' consensus historian. In works like The American Political Tradition (1948) and Anti-Intellectualism in American Life (1963), Hofstadter acknowledged the consensus—but he often found it troubling rather than reassuring.

Hofstadter wrote brilliantly about what he called 'the paranoid style in American politics'—the recurring tendency toward conspiracy thinking, nativism, and anti-intellectualism. He suggested that the very lack of deep ideological conflict in America had produced a politics of status anxiety and symbolic crusades. Americans agreed on fundamentals, so they fought bitterly over symbols and scapegoats. This is a much more ambivalent reading of American consensus—and one that feels remarkably prescient in our current moment.

## The Ideological Turn: Taking Ideas Seriously

In the 1960s and beyond, another group of historians mounted a different challenge to the Progressive tradition. Where Beard had suggested that the Founders' rhetoric about liberty and republicanism was largely a cover for economic interests, scholars like Bernard Bailyn and Gordon Wood said: wait a minute. What if they actually meant it?

This 'Ideological School' or 'Republican Synthesis' insisted that we must take the ideas of the past seriously, not as mere rationalizations, but as genuine motivating forces.

Bernard Bailyn, in The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution (1967), traced the pamphlet literature of the Revolutionary era. He showed how American colonists were steeped in a particular intellectual tradition—'Country' or 'Commonwealth' thought—that emphasized the constant threat of political corruption and tyranny. They genuinely believed that British measures like the Stamp Act represented the first steps toward despotism. Their fears were ideological, not merely material.

Gordon Wood, in The Radicalism of the American Revolution (1992), went further. He argued that the Revolution was genuinely radical—not in the sense of the French or Russian revolutions, perhaps, but radical nonetheless. It represented a fundamental transformation in how people thought about political and social authority, moving from a world of deference and hierarchy to one of equality and self-governance.

***Historiographical Analysis: Ideological School***

**What's the engine of change here?** Ideas themselves. Beliefs, fears, visions of what the world should be. The Ideological Turn reminds us that human beings are not purely economic creatures. We are moved by convictions that can't be reduced to material interest.

This represents a direct challenge to both Progressive/Marxist approaches (which emphasize material conditions) and to Consensus history (which downplayed ideological conflict by suggesting Americans all basically agreed). The Ideological School says: no, there were genuine, passionate ideological commitments—and they mattered.

Any history that reduces human action to simple calculations of material interest is missing something essential about how people actually think and act.
