# Chapter 20 — Urbanization  
## Lecture 2: Race, Exclusion, and the Architecture of Belonging  
**Time:** 50 minutes  
**Purpose:** Examine how race, law, and cultural discourse structured who could belong in American cities—and who could not—during the age of mass migration.

---

## Big Framing Idea (5 minutes)

Urbanization did not produce openness by default.  
It produced **boundaries**.

As American cities filled with newcomers, the United States increasingly defined itself not just by citizenship, but by **race**. Immigration law, labor systems, and popular culture worked together to decide who could enter, stay, work, and belong.

Key claim for students:  
Pluralism expanded—but **selectively**. Race set hard limits on inclusion.

## I. Asian Migration in Global Context (8 minutes)

Begin by decentering the United States.

- Asian migration was part of **global labor circulation**, not a U.S.-specific phenomenon
- Chinese emigration surged during the “Century of Revolution” (c. 1850–1949)
- Migrants moved to:
  - Southeast Asia
  - Hawaii
  - Latin America
  - Western United States

Chinese migrants were not refugees in the modern sense:
- Many were **sojourners**
- Intended to work temporarily and return home
- Maintained strong homeland ties (remittances, kinship obligations)

Key point:
Asian migration was **transnational**, circular, and deeply shaped by empire and capitalism.

---

## II. Labor, Race, and the Racialization of Work (8 minutes)

Asian labor became racialized early and aggressively.

- Burlingame Treaty (1868) encouraged Chinese labor migration
- “Coolie labor” framed as:
  - Unfree
  - Degrading
  - Racially distinct
- Chinese workers used in:
  - Mining
  - Railroad construction
  - Agriculture
  - Urban service trades

Central tension:
- Employers valued Chinese labor as cheap and reliable
- White workers saw Chinese labor as a racial threat

Important clarification:
Hostility was not just economic—it was **racial and cultural**, rooted in ideas of civilization and whiteness.

---

## III. Gender, Family, and the Logic of Exclusion (7 minutes)

Exclusion targeted **family formation**, not just labor.

- Early Chinese migration was overwhelmingly male
- White Americans framed Chinese communities as:
  - Immoral
  - Diseased
  - Socially dangerous

Key legal moment:
- **Page Law (1875)**  
  Effectively barred Chinese women by labeling them presumed prostitutes

Consequences:
- Prevented family formation
- Reinforced the “permanent foreigner” stereotype
- Made assimilation structurally impossible

Key insight:
Exclusion worked by **disrupting reproduction**, not just entry.

---

## IV. Law as a Tool of Racial Boundary-Making (10 minutes)

This is where race hardens into policy.

Major legal landmarks:
- Naturalization Act of 1790 / 1870  
  Citizenship limited to “white persons” and persons of African descent
- **Chinese Exclusion Act (1882)**  
  First federal law banning immigration by race
- Asiatic Barred Zone (1917)
- National Origins Act (1924)

Critical shift:
Immigration policy moves from **economic regulation** to **racial engineering**.

Students should see:
These laws do not respond to Chinese migration—they **redefine American identity**.

---

## V. “Yellow Peril”: Race, Fear, and Popular Culture (7 minutes)

Law does not operate alone. Culture prepares the ground.

### Yellow Peril Discourse
- Asians portrayed as:
  - Inscrutable
  - Unassimilable
  - Dangerous
  - Civilization-threatening
- Fueled by:
  - Pseudoscience
  - Imperial anxiety
  - Global power shifts

Examples:
- Political cartoons
- Kaiser Wilhelm’s *Gelbe Gefahr*
- Pulp fiction villains (e.g., Fu Manchu)
- Newspapers and postcards

Key analytical move:
This is **discourse**, not description—a system of meaning that produces fear as “truth.”

---

## VI. Survival, Adaptation, and Enclave Formation (5 minutes)

Despite exclusion, Asian communities endured.

Strategies:
- Ethnic enclaves (Chinatowns, fishing villages, labor camps)
- Self-employment (laundries, restaurants, small shops)
- Mutual-aid societies
- Informal migration strategies (e.g., paper sons)

Important reframing:
Enclaves are not signs of isolation—they are **responses to enforced exclusion**.

---

## Closing Synthesis (5 minutes)

Asian exclusion reveals the limits of American pluralism.

- Cities became diverse—but not equally inclusive
- Law, labor, and culture worked together to racialize belonging
- Urbanization intensified debates over:
  - Citizenship
  - Race
  - Nationhood

Bridge forward:
The next lecture turns inward—to the **urban environment itself**—showing how density, disease, and infrastructure forced cities to confront the biological consequences of mass migration.

---

## Key Takeaway

Urban America was built through inclusion **and** exclusion.  
Race determined not just who entered the city, but who could belong, reproduce, and claim the future.

Lecture Prep Reading List (Instructor)

Impossible Subjects — Mae Ngai
Essential for understanding how immigration restriction created the category of the “illegal alien” and fused race, law, and national identity.

The Chinese Exclusion Act — Erika Lee
The clearest single-volume account of how exclusion emerged from labor conflict, racial ideology, and local violence rather than abstract nationalism.

Asian American History — Sucheng Chan
Strong on transnational migration and sojourner culture; helps decenter the U.S. and frame Asian migration as part of global labor circulation.

Coolies and Cane — Moon-Ho Jung
Excellent for explaining how “coolie labor” became racialized and morally stigmatized, shaping white labor politics and exclusionary law.

Yellow Peril! — John Kuo Wei Tchen
Valuable for unpacking how fear was produced through popular culture, visual media, and political discourse rather than direct experience.
