# Chapter 26 — Lecture 3
## What Were We Fighting? Fascist Atrocities and American Knowledge

### Central Question
What did Americans know about fascist violence, and how did that knowledge shape the war?

---

## I. Student Starting Point

Most students arrive knowing that "the Holocaust happened" but lack a sense of timing, process, and policy. Knowledge of Japanese atrocities is usually absent.

This lecture fills that gap to clarify what was at stake in the war.

---

## II. Nazi Atrocities as Policy

Persecution evolves into segregation and then extermination. Violence is bureaucratized and normalized. Genocide emerges from ideology, not battlefield excess.

---

## III. What Americans Knew During the War

Information circulated through newspapers, diplomats, and refugees. Knowledge was fragmented, often doubted, and overshadowed by wartime priorities.

Disbelief persisted due to the legacy of World War I propaganda, antisemitism, and the implausible scale of reported crimes.

---

## IV. Japanese Atrocities in Asia and the Pacific

Japanese imperial warfare included mass violence against civilians, brutal POW treatment, and terror campaigns in occupied territories.

These atrocities were known during the war but later marginalized in American memory.

---

## V. Liberation as Moral Rupture

The liberation of concentration camps in 1945 transforms abstract reports into undeniable reality. Visual evidence reshapes American understanding of the war.

---

### Lecture Takeaway

Atrocities explain unconditional surrender, moral absolutism, and why World War II becomes remembered as a "good war" in American memory.
