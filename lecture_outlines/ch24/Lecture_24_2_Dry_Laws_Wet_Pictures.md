# Lecture 2 — Dry Laws, Wet Pictures: Prohibition as Performance

## Lecture Focus
This lecture reframes Prohibition as a cultural performance rather than a legal success or failure. Photography plays a central role by turning lawbreaking, enforcement, and hypocrisy into public spectacle.

## Big Questions
- Why did Prohibition fail so visibly?
- How did photography reshape public attitudes toward law and authority?
- What does Prohibition reveal about class, power, and selective enforcement?

## I. The Moral Logic Behind Prohibition
- Rooted in Protestant reform movements.
- Alcohol framed as the cause of poverty, crime, and moral decay.
- National ban reflects confidence in moral legislation.

## II. The Reality of Prohibition
- Demand for alcohol never disappears.
- Speakeasies proliferate in urban areas.
- Drinking becomes more public, not less.
- Women enter nightlife spaces once dominated by men.

## III. Photography and the Theater of Enforcement
- Police raids photographed for newspapers.
- Raids staged to demonstrate action rather than effectiveness.
- Images create the appearance of control.
- Enforcement varies sharply by class and race.

## IV. Crime, Celebrity, and the Camera
- Gangsters pose deliberately for photographers.
- Criminals become public figures.
- Media coverage blurs line between outlaw and celebrity.
- Crime becomes part of entertainment culture.

## V. Hypocrisy Made Visible
- Photographs show elites drinking privately.
- Working-class and immigrant communities policed more aggressively.
- Photography teaches cynicism toward law.
- Respect for authority erodes through repeated visual contradiction.

## Closing Takeaway
Prohibition did not collapse quietly. It collapsed in full view of the camera. Photography transformed a moral crusade into a national joke and taught Americans to distrust laws that contradicted lived experience.
