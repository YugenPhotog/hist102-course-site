# Chapter 20 — Urbanization  
## Lecture 1: Migration and Diaspora — How the World Came to the City  
**Time:** 50 minutes  
**Purpose:** Frame urbanization as a global migration story shaped by diaspora, networks, and power—not simply population growth.

---

## Big Framing Idea (5 minutes)

Urbanization is not just Americans moving into cities.  
It is the **world in motion**, driven by industrial capitalism, imperial disruption, political violence, and transportation revolutions.

Late-19th-century American cities are **nodes in global systems** of labor, capital, and migration.

Key claim for students:  
Urban growth reflects constrained choices made under pressure—not free individual preference.

## I. The Lure of the City: Why Cities Exploded (8 minutes)

Industrial capitalism reorganized space and labor.

- Factories required **concentrated wage labor**
- Railroads, steamships, and telegraph compressed time and distance
- Cities became engines of opportunity and risk

Key shifts:
- By 1900, ~40% of Americans lived in cities
- By 1920, a majority did
- Six cities exceeded 500,000 people by 1900

Cultural reversal:
- Antebellum suspicion of cities → post-1870 celebration of cities as modern, dynamic, and inevitable

Important clarification:
Urbanization is not “natural growth”—it is a **structural outcome of industrial systems**.

## II. “New Immigrants” and the Scale of Migration (7 minutes)

Late-19th-century migration differs sharply from earlier waves.

- Shift from northern/western Europe → southern and eastern Europe
- By 1890, 15% of U.S. population was foreign-born
- By 1900, most urban residents were immigrants or their children
- Migration often occurred **as families**, not lone adventurers
- Higher birth rates among immigrants accelerated urban growth

Correcting the Ellis Island myth:
Migration involved debt, danger, and permanent rupture—not simple optimism.

## III. Conceptual Toolkit: Diaspora, Not Assimilation (10 minutes)

This lecture uses **diaspora** as its core analytical framework.

### Diaspora
- Dispersal from a homeland
- Ongoing cultural, emotional, and institutional ties
- Longing, memory, and identity persist after migration

Contrast with older models:
- “Uprooted” → loss of culture
- “Transplanted” → cultural adaptation and continuity

Key analytical tools:
- **Push factors:** violence, persecution, land loss, economic collapse
- **Pull factors:** wages, safety, networks, opportunity
- **Chain migration:** movement follows kinship and community ties
- **Homeland vs. host tension:** belonging without full acceptance

Core insight:
Cities grow through **networks**, not randomness.

---

## IV. Building Ethnic Worlds Inside American Cities (8 minutes)

Immigrants deliberately clustered to reduce risk and preserve autonomy.

Key institutions:
- Churches and synagogues
- Ethnic newspapers
- Mutual-aid societies
- Fraternal and benevolent organizations

Functions of ethnic institutions:
- Economic survival
- Cultural continuity
- Childcare and education
- Political organization

Critical reframing:
Ethnic enclaves are **adaptive strategies**, not failures to assimilate.

---

## V. Nativism and the Anxiety of Belonging (7 minutes)

Large-scale migration produced intense backlash.

### Nativism
Preference for native-born Americans over immigrants

Historical trajectory:
- Antebellum: Irish Catholics (Know-Nothing movement)
- Post-1870: Catholics, Jews, southern/eastern Europeans, Asians

New justifications:
- Social Darwinism
- Racial hierarchies
- Pseudoscientific claims about heredity and “fitness”

Central contradiction:
Industrial capitalism **required** immigrant labor  
Cultural politics **resisted** immigrant presence

---

## VI. The City as a Site of Cultural Negotiation (5 minutes)

Cities are not melting pots—they are **contested spaces**.

- Immigrants reshape food, religion, music, labor, and politics
- Conflict is normal, not pathological
- Urban life produces pluralism through tension, not harmony

Bridge forward:
Next lecture examines where pluralism ended—**race, law, and exclusion**, especially for Asian migrants.

---

## Key Takeaway

Urbanization reflects global movement under pressure.  
Cities become laboratories for modern identity, conflict, and belonging.
