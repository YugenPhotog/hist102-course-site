# Lecture 1 — 1898 as Spectacle: Roosevelt and the New Politics of War

## Lecture Purpose
This lecture examines how the Spanish–American War became politically irresistible in the United States. Rather than repeating causes or military events, the focus is on war as a media-driven emotional crisis and on Theodore Roosevelt as a figure who understood—and thrived within—the new politics of spectacle.


## Lecture Prep — Suggested Reading List

### Required (short, high-impact)
- **Brief primary-source set:** Two front-page newspaper excerpts from 1898 covering Cuba and/or the USS *Maine* (one sensational, one restrained).  
- **Theodore Roosevelt, “The Strenuous Life” (1899)** — short excerpt (2–4 pages). Focus on the language of vigor, duty, and national “manliness.”

### Recommended (for enrichment or advanced students)
- **Kristin L. Hoganson, _Fighting for American Manhood_** — a short excerpt or summary on gender, nationalism, and the politics of 1898.  
- **Amy Kaplan, “Manifest Domesticity”** (essay excerpt) — how empire reshapes domestic culture and identity.  
- **A political cartoon set (2–3 cartoons)** from 1898–1900 on “uplift,” “civilization,” or annexation (for visual analysis practice).

> **Instructor note:** Keep the prep light. The goal is to prime students to recognize *spectacle, moral framing, and the gap between event and meaning*—not to frontload the entire war narrative.

## I. Framing the Problem: Why 1898 Feels “Modern”
**Key idea:** By the late 1890s, the United States had entered a new political ecosystem shaped by mass media, rapid information flow, and emotionally mobilized public opinion.

- Americans had fought wars before, but never with:
  - national daily newspapers,
  - illustrated reporting,
  - rapid circulation of rumor and outrage,
  - moral judgment delivered in headlines.
- The Spanish–American War is short militarily but enormous culturally.
- This lecture treats 1898 as a media event, not just a diplomatic or military episode.

## II. The Media Revolution of the 1890s
**Key concept:** Mass persuasion

- By the 1890s, newspapers reached millions of readers daily.
- Competition for readership favored:
  - sensational language,
  - dramatic narratives,
  - moral clarity over nuance.
- “Yellow journalism” accelerated emotion more than it fabricated facts.
- Exaggeration compressed time:
  - diplomacy seemed slow,
  - restraint seemed immoral,
  - action felt urgent.

**Analytical distinction for students:**
- *Event* — what actually happened
- *Representation* — how Americans encountered those events through media

---

## III. Cuba as Moral Theater
**Key idea:** Cuba functioned as a symbolic stage rather than a fully understood political struggle.

- Cuban suffering was real, but selectively framed.
- Reporting emphasized:
  - helpless victims,
  - cruel Spanish authority,
  - moral urgency for intervention.
- Little attention was paid to:
  - Cuba’s long revolutionary history,
  - Cuban political leadership,
  - alternative paths to independence.

**Takeaway:** Cuba appeared as a problem demanding American action, not as a nation with agency.

## IV. The USS *Maine*: Event vs. Meaning
**Core distinction:**
- Explosion = historical event
- “Remember the Maine” = political meaning

- The cause of the explosion was unclear in 1898.
- Certainty appeared in headlines before investigations.
- The slogan transformed ambiguity into obligation.

**Teaching point:** Democracies often act on meaning rather than certainty.

## V. Theodore Roosevelt Enters the Story
**Why Roosevelt matters here:** Not because he caused the war, but because he understood the new rules of politics.

### Roosevelt as Assistant Secretary of the Navy
- Advocated preparedness and expansion.
- Viewed war as a national test and opportunity.
- Valued speed, decisiveness, and visibility.

### Strategic Resignation
- Left bureaucracy at a critical moment.
- Converted policy enthusiasm into personal narrative.

### The Rough Riders
- Militarily modest impact.
- Symbolically enormous importance.
- Embodied:
  - masculinity,
  - voluntarism,
  - elite leadership paired with frontier imagery.

**Analytical framing:** Roosevelt was adaptive, not reckless—he grasped that modern power required publicity and heroism.

---

## VI. War as Performance, Leadership as Visibility
**Core concept:** Modern leadership requires being seen doing the right thing.

- Photographs, illustrations, and interviews mattered.
- Roosevelt’s war experience became political capital.
- The war produced celebrities as much as soldiers.

**Bridge forward:** The skills learned here will matter after the war ends.

---

## VII. Synthesis and Takeaways
By 1898:
- War could be sold, not just justified.
- Public emotion became a political resource.
- Media shaped urgency and morality.
- Leaders who mastered spectacle gained power.

**Transition to Lecture 2:**  
If this lecture shows how war became acceptable, the next lecture asks what happens when victory produces responsibility instead of applause.

## Optional In-Class Activity
### Headline Dissection
Provide two headlines describing the same Cuban incident.

Students identify:
1. Emotion words  
2. Moral framing  
3. Implied action  

**Discussion prompt:** Which version makes war feel unavoidable—and why?
