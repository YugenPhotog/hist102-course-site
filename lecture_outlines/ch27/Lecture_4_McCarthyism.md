# Lecture 4 — McCarthyism: Fear, Performance, and the Fragility of Democracy

## Lecture Purpose
This lecture places McCarthyism at the center of the Cold War home front, showing how fear, secrecy, and performance politics undermined democratic norms even as real security threats existed.

## Key Questions
- Why did McCarthyism flourish?
- How did institutions enable rather than restrain it?
- What survived after McCarthy fell?

## I. Real Espionage, Uneven Knowledge
- Soviet intelligence operations
- Classified evidence and public ignorance
- Asymmetry between fear and proof

## II. HUAC and Loyalty Investigations
- Public performances of accusation
- Guilt by association
- Cultural and professional blacklists

## III. Espionage Cases
- Venona Project (classified)
- Alger Hiss and Whittaker Chambers
- Klaus Fuchs
- Julius and Ethel Rosenberg

## IV. McCarthy’s Method
- Accusation without evidence
- Moving targets and numerical claims
- Media spectacle and intimidation

## V. Institutional Failure
- Executive hesitation
- Congressional complicity
- Media amplification

## VI. Collapse and Containment
- Army–McCarthy hearings
- Public exposure
- Senate censure

## VII. The Afterlife of McCarthyism
- Loyalty oaths remain
- Surveillance expands
- Fear becomes routine

## Takeaway
McCarthyism collapses as a style, not as a system. The security state endures.
