# Chapter 25 — Lecture 1
## Failure Without Villains: Hoover vs. Roosevelt

### Lecture Purpose
This lecture dismantles the simplified narrative that Herbert Hoover caused the Great Depression and Franklin D. Roosevelt saved the nation. Instead, it reframes both men as constrained actors operating within inherited political philosophies under unprecedented economic collapse.

The goal is to replace moral judgment with historical understanding.

## I. Opening Frame: The Myth Students Bring In

Most students arrive with a simple story:
- Hoover was heartless and inactive.
- FDR fixed the Depression.

This lecture begins by rejecting that framework. The Great Depression was not a morality play. It was a stress test of governing assumptions developed in a different era.

**Key premise:** History rewards fit between ideas and moments, not good intentions.

## II. Herbert Hoover: The Last President of the Old Moral Economy

### A. Hoover’s Governing Philosophy
Hoover believed deeply in voluntarism, associationalism, and civic cooperation without coercion. He feared that direct federal relief would undermine character and weaken democratic citizenship.

These beliefs reflected mainstream late-19th-century liberalism, not indifference.

### B. What Hoover Actually Did
Hoover expanded federal intervention beyond any previous peacetime president:
- Public works support
- Federal coordination with banks and industry
- Creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation

His interventions were indirect and institutional rather than personal.

### C. Why Hoover Failed
Hoover’s approach assumed:
- A short downturn
- Functional private institutions
- Shame as a motivator

The Depression instead produced mass, public humiliation.

**Key insight:** Hoover governed as if suffering should remain private. The Depression made suffering unavoidable and visible.

## III. Franklin D. Roosevelt: Confidence Before Solutions

### A. What FDR Did Not Have
Roosevelt entered office without:
- A master plan
- A coherent economic ideology
- A clear path to recovery

New Deal programs frequently contradicted one another.

### B. What FDR Understood
Roosevelt grasped that despair itself was politically destabilizing. His priority was restoring confidence, not solving the economy.

### C. Fireside Chats as Governance
Fireside chats made the federal government:
- Audible
- Present
- Emotionally reassuring

**Key insight:** Roosevelt did not end the Depression. He ended the feeling of abandonment.

## IV. Synthesis
Leadership success depends less on moral character than on whether governing ideas match historical conditions.
