# Chapter 26 — Lecture 1
## Fascism and the Politics of Expansion

### Central Question
Why did fascist regimes *need* expansion and war to survive?

## I. What Fascism Is (and Is Not)

Fascism is often misunderstood as simple dictatorship or irrational brutality. In reality, fascism is a **modern political ideology** that embraces mass politics, technology, propaganda, and spectacle while rejecting liberal democracy.

Fascism is **not** traditional conservatism, nostalgia, or a rejection of modernity. It is aggressively modern in its use of bureaucracy, mass media, and organized violence.

Crucially, fascism does not promise peace or stability. It promises **permanent mobilization**.

## II. Core Ideological Components of Fascism

### Mythic Nationalism
The nation is imagined as an organic, eternal body. Decline is blamed on internal enemies and external threats. History is rewritten as myth rather than analysis.

### Anti-Liberalism
Individual rights, minority protections, and compromise are rejected. Democracy is framed as weakness and decadence. Law exists to serve the nation, not restrain power.

### Anti-Marxism
Class conflict is replaced with racial or national unity. Labor is subordinated to the state. Independent unions and socialist movements are suppressed.

### Cult of Violence
Violence is understood as cleansing and regenerative. War is treated as a moral test of national vitality. Peace is associated with decay.

## III. Expansion as Ideological Necessity

Expansion is not optional for fascist regimes. Legitimacy depends on visible national rebirth, external enemies justify repression, economic autarky demands territory, and war silences dissent.

War is not a failure of fascism. War is **proof that fascism is working**.

## IV. Why Liberal Democracies Misread Fascism

Liberal democracies assume rational actors, limited objectives, and negotiable interests. Fascist regimes reject all three. Diplomacy becomes tactical theater. Concessions invite escalation.

### Lecture Takeaway

World War II begins not with battlefield clashes, but with an **ideological conflict** over whether expansionist fascism or liberal democracy will define modernity.
