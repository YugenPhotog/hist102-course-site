# Lecture 2 — Modernism and Disillusionment: Making Meaning After the War

## Lecture Purpose

This lecture explains how Americans and Europeans attempted to process catastrophe after World War I and the influenza pandemic. Rather than treating modernism as an elite artistic rebellion, the lecture frames it as a cultural response to a world that no longer made moral, narrative, or emotional sense.

Modernism is treated here as historical evidence. Cultural rupture reveals how deeply confidence in progress, rationality, and inherited traditions had been shaken.

## I. Before the War: Cracks in the Old World

Before 1914, many Americans and Europeans shared a broad faith in progress.

- Scientific advancement promised mastery over nature  
- Industrial growth suggested rising prosperity  
- Liberal democracy appeared stable and expanding  
- Cultural traditions assumed coherence and moral order  

Yet even before the war, signs of strain appeared. Experimental art and literature challenged realism and narrative clarity. Events such as the Armory Show of 1913 shocked audiences and critics, who often dismissed modern art as chaotic, ugly, or meaningless.

Key framing idea:  
Before the war, modernism looks wrong.  
After the war, it looks honest.

## II. World War I and the Collapse of Narrative

World War I destroys the moral and narrative assumptions that sustained older cultural forms.

- Mechanized warfare produces anonymous, mass death  
- Soldiers experience time as disjointed and repetitive  
- Command structures feel distant and indifferent  
- Individual sacrifice no longer guarantees meaning  

The influenza pandemic intensifies this rupture.

- Death arrives suddenly and invisibly  
- Victims include the young and healthy  
- Loss lacks heroism or purpose  

Together, war and pandemic undermine the stories societies relied on to explain suffering.

Modernism emerges not as rebellion, but as recognition.

## III. What Is Modernism?

Modernism is best understood as a change in form rather than ideology.

Common characteristics include:

- Fragmentation instead of linear narrative  
- Ambiguity instead of moral certainty  
- Experimentation instead of tradition  
- Irony instead of reverence  

These features reflect lived experience. Older artistic forms cannot adequately represent industrial war, mass death, or psychological trauma. New forms attempt to capture confusion, alienation, and discontinuity.

Modernism does not argue that nothing matters.  
It argues that inherited ways of explaining meaning no longer work.

## IV. Language, Art, and the Breakdown of Sense

Modernist techniques mirror historical conditions.

- Fragmented language reflects fractured experience  
- Nonlinear structure resembles traumatic memory  
- Abstraction conveys emotional and psychological truth  

Traditional realism assumes a stable world. Modernism assumes instability.

The difficulty of modernist art is not accidental. It reflects the difficulty of describing a world that feels incoherent.

## V. The Harlem Renaissance: Culture and Assertion

The Great Migration transforms American cities during and after the war. African American artists and writers confront racial violence, segregation, and unfulfilled democratic promises.

The Harlem Renaissance shares modernist experimentation but adds a political edge.

- Cultural expression becomes self-definition  
- Art asserts dignity and visibility  
- Creativity challenges exclusion from citizenship  

Modernism here is not withdrawal from politics. It is engagement under constraint.

This cultural assertion sets the stage for backlash and racial violence in 1919.

## VI. From Cultural Rupture to Political Conflict

Cultural experimentation does not resolve economic instability, racial hierarchy, or political fear.

As meaning fractures:

- Some embrace ambiguity and experimentation  
- Others demand order and certainty  

For many Americans, uncertainty feels dangerous. The state increasingly responds by narrowing acceptable speech, belief, and identity.

Cultural rupture precedes political repression.

---

## Final Takeaway

Modernism records a world that has lost confidence in its inherited explanations of reality.

World War I and the influenza pandemic reshape not only politics, but perception itself. When meaning fractures, societies search for stability—sometimes through creativity, sometimes through coercion.

This tension defines the postwar era.
