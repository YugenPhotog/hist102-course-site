# Lecture 1 — Asia Remade: Defeat, Occupation, and the First Cold War Choices (1945–1949)

## Lecture Purpose
This lecture reframes the origins of the Cold War by placing Asia—not Europe—at the center. Students examine how U.S. power, liberal ideals, and strategic necessity collided immediately after World War II, producing the first compromises that would define the Cold War order.

## Key Questions
- How did U.S. occupation policies reshape postwar Asia?
- Why did Cold War moral compromises appear first in Japan?
- What assumptions guided U.S. involvement in China—and why did they fail?

## I. From Total War to Uncertain Peace
- Scale of destruction in Asia after WWII
- U.S. confidence following victory
- Assumption that American power and expertise could remake societies

## II. U.S. Occupation of Japan
- Goals: demilitarization, democratization, economic stabilization
- Role of General Douglas MacArthur
- 1947 Japanese Constitution
- Japan as a prospective Cold War ally rather than a defeated enemy

## III. The Tokyo Trials (Single Slide Focus)
- Purpose: prosecuting war crimes and aggression
- Selective justice: Emperor Hirohito not prosecuted
- The U.S. as victor, occupier, and judge
- Cold War priorities shaping postwar justice

## IV. The Chinese Civil War
- Nationalists vs. Communists
- U.S. financial and military support for Chiang Kai-shek
- Limits of American influence
- Why outcomes did not align with U.S. expectations

## V. The China Hands
- Role of professional diplomats and regional experts
- Warnings about Nationalist weaknesses
- Growing hostility toward expertise and nuance

## Takeaway
The Cold War begins with moral compromise in Asia. Liberal ideals are subordinated to strategy almost immediately.
