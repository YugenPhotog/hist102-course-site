# Module Introduction — War, Trauma, and Democracy, 1914–1920

World War I is often remembered as a foreign war with a tidy ending: an armistice in November 1918, a peace conference in Paris, and the United States’ return to “normalcy.” This module asks students to set that story aside.

Instead, these lectures examine World War I as a **transformative crisis that reshaped American society from the inside out**. The focus is not on battlefield tactics or diplomatic timelines, but on how modern war, mass death, and political fear altered trust in institutions, cultural meaning, and the boundaries of democracy itself.

Across these lectures, students will explore three interlocking questions:

- What happens when a modern state capable of total mobilization fails to protect human life?
- How do people make meaning after catastrophe shatters inherited assumptions about progress and order?
- How does democracy respond when fear, instability, and social conflict converge?

The module begins with the **influenza pandemic**, a crisis produced and amplified by total war. The pandemic exposes the limits of expertise and state power, leaving behind widespread grief, anxiety, and disillusionment. This trauma forms the emotional foundation of the postwar era.

The second lecture turns to **modernism and cultural rupture**, showing how artists, writers, and musicians grappled with a world that no longer made narrative or moral sense. Cultural experimentation becomes a form of historical evidence—revealing how deeply war and pandemic fractured confidence in traditional explanations of reality.

The module concludes with **Red Summer, the Red Scare, and the Sacco–Vanzetti case**, unifying racial violence, labor unrest, and political repression into a single story about contested democracy. Here, fear becomes policy, dissent becomes suspect, and the boundaries of belonging are drawn tighter around race, ideology, and immigration status.

Taken together, these lectures show that World War I did not simply end in 1918. It ended unevenly, painfully, and incompletely—leaving behind a society struggling to reconcile democratic ideals with the legacies of trauma and fear.

This module prepares students to understand the 1920s not as a sudden break from wartime crisis, but as a decade shaped by its unresolved consequences.
