# Chapter 26 — Lecture 2
## Total War at Home: Mobilization, Internment, and Democratic Limits

### Central Question
What happens to democracy when survival becomes the priority?

---

## I. Pearl Harbor and the Logic of Total War

Pearl Harbor functions as a trigger rather than a cause. It produces immediate national consensus around total mobilization and a commitment to **total war**, not limited conflict.

---

## II. Economic Mobilization and the Managed Economy

The federal government coordinates production, prices, wages, labor supply, and raw materials. The War Production Board integrates private industry into state planning.

World War II completes the transformation begun during the New Deal: the federal government becomes a permanent economic manager.

---

## III. Labor, Discipline, and State Authority

Labor accepts a no-strike pledge. Wages are controlled. Arbitration replaces collective bargaining. Workers gain stability and employment at the cost of autonomy.

---

## IV. Gender and Wartime Labor

Women enter industrial and defense work in unprecedented numbers. Government propaganda frames this labor as patriotic and temporary rather than emancipatory.

Postwar expectations anticipate a return to domestic roles.

---

## V. Japanese American Internment

Executive Order 9066 authorizes the forced relocation and incarceration of Japanese Americans.

Internment reflects racialized security logic rather than proven threat. It demonstrates how constitutional rights can be suspended under wartime pressure.

---

## VI. Race and the Double V Campaign

African American soldiers and workers link victory abroad with demands for democracy at home. The war accelerates civil rights consciousness while exposing enduring inequalities.

---

### Lecture Takeaway

The United States fights fascism abroad while **contracting democracy at home**, a tension that reshapes the modern American state.
