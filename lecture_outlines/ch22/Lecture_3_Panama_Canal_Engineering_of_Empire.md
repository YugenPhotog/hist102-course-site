# Lecture 3 — Theodore Roosevelt, the Panama Canal, and the Engineering of Empire

## Lecture Purpose
This lecture explains how the United States transformed wartime expansion into permanent global power. Rather than focusing on diplomacy alone, it examines infrastructure—especially the Panama Canal—as the moment when American empire became logistical, technical, and enduring. By the time World War I begins, the United States is already a global system-builder.

## Lecture Prep — Suggested Reading List

### Required (short, high-impact)
- **Primary-source excerpt:** Theodore Roosevelt, selected statements or speeches on the Panama Canal emphasizing action, order, and necessity.  
- **Visual source set:** Photographs of Panama Canal construction, labor camps, and sanitation efforts (for discussion of labor, race, and disease).

### Recommended (for enrichment or advanced students)
- **Julie Greene, _The Canal Builders_** — short excerpt on labor regimes and daily life in the Canal Zone.  
- **David McCullough, _The Path Between the Seas_** — brief excerpt on the political and engineering challenges of canal construction.  
- **Panamanian perspective source:** Short reading or summary describing Panamanian reactions to U.S. control of the Canal Zone.

> **Instructor note:** The goal of the prep is to foreground empire as *infrastructure and systems*, not merely foreign policy. Students should arrive prepared to think about power in material and logistical terms.

## I. Framing the Problem: From War to Permanence
**Key claim:** Empires are secured not by victory alone, but by systems.

- Previous lectures showed:
  - how war became politically acceptable,
  - how empire required coercive occupation.
- This lecture asks a new question:
  - How does imperial power become permanent?
- Treaties fade; infrastructure endures.

## II. Why the Canal Matters More Than Battles
**Key idea:** The Panama Canal represents a strategic reorientation of American power.

- Before the canal:
  - Atlantic and Pacific fleets operated separately.
- After the canal:
  - The United States becomes a two-ocean power in practice.
  - Military, commercial, and diplomatic response times accelerate.

**Conceptual payoff:** Controlling movement can matter more than controlling territory.

---

## III. The Canal Zone: Sovereignty Without Nationhood
**Key claim:** The Canal Zone exemplifies empire through control of corridors rather than countries.

- The United States does not formally annex Panama.
- Instead, it controls:
  - a narrow strip of land,
  - strategic chokepoints,
  - legal authority within the zone.
- Sovereignty becomes selective and functional.

This is empire without traditional colonial language, but with real coercive power.

## IV. Theodore Roosevelt as Imperial Systems-Builder
**Why Roosevelt matters here:** He connects war, occupation, and infrastructure into a coherent worldview.

- Roosevelt valued:
  - speed over delay,
  - action over negotiation,
  - engineering over diplomacy.
- The canal reflects lessons learned after 1898:
  - decisive force,
  - logistical thinking,
  - confidence in American authority.

Roosevelt applies imperial habits rather than improvising them.

## V. Engineering Empire: Labor, Disease, and Daily Control
**Key claim:** Empire operates through mundane systems.

### Disease control
- Yellow fever and malaria threatened the project.
- Sanitation became a strategic tool.
- Public health enabled military and commercial power.

### Labor regimes
- Workforce divided along racial and national lines.
- Unequal pay, housing, and working conditions.
- Hierarchy structured daily life in the Canal Zone.

**Analytical payoff:** Empire classifies bodies, manages labor, and organizes space.

---

## VI. Infrastructure and Political Time
**Key idea:** Infrastructure reshapes political time.

- Canals and shipping routes create durability.
- Decisions made once shape behavior for generations.
- Empire becomes easier to maintain because it becomes normal.

**Teaching prompt:** Which lasts longer—speeches or ports?

---

## VII. Neutrality Reconsidered
**Key reframing:** By the 1910s, American neutrality is a posture, not a condition.

- The United States is deeply embedded in global trade.
- It controls key routes and chokepoints.
- It can choose neutrality from a position of strength.

This reframing sets up World War I.

## VIII. Endcap — Did the United States “Give” the Panama Canal to Panama?

**Short answer:** yes—but very late, and only after decades of pressure.

After supporting Panama’s separation from Colombia in 1903, the United States gained control of the Canal Zone through the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty. In practice, this gave the U.S. permanent sovereign authority over a strategic corridor inside another country. For most of the twentieth century, the canal functioned as an American-controlled space.

For decades:
- The Canal Zone operated as a de facto U.S. colony.
- Panamanians had limited rights within it.
- The canal symbolized American power in Latin America.

Change came slowly. In 1977, the United States and Panama signed the Torrijos–Carter Treaties, which ended claims of permanent U.S. control and established a gradual transfer of authority.

Key milestones:
- **1979:** Canal Zone abolished; joint administration begins  
- **1999:** Full control transferred to Panama

On December 31, 1999, Panama assumed complete control of the Panama Canal.

### Why this matters
This was not a gift. It was the result of decades of resistance and negotiation, and a reminder that infrastructure outlasts wars, presidents, and ideologies.

**Final takeaway:** Empires are built quickly but dismantled slowly.

## Optional Endcap Discussion
**Prompt:**  
If infrastructure creates durable power, what kinds of pressure are required to dismantle it?  
Should control of global infrastructure ever belong permanently to a single nation?
