## Ending the War and Inventing American Power: The Atomic Bomb

### Central Question
What kind of power emerges from total war?

---

## I. Europe First (Brief Context)

The defeat of Nazi Germany ends the European war and frees American resources for final escalation in the Pacific.

---

## II. The Pacific War as Industrialized Annihilation

Island-hopping campaigns, firebombing, and civilian targeting characterize the final phase of the Pacific War. Casualty projections eliminate restraint from strategic thinking.

---

## III. The Atomic Bomb

The atomic bomb is simultaneously:
- a military weapon
- a political signal
- a moral rupture

The Manhattan Project demonstrates unprecedented state-science collaboration. Hiroshima and Nagasaki force Japan's surrender.

---

## IV. A New World Emerges

The United States emerges as a global superpower with nuclear monopoly and unmatched destructive capacity. Responsibility expands without precedent.

---

### Final Synthesis

World War II defeats fascism but normalizes total war and inaugurates the nuclear age. The war ends, but its consequences define the modern world.
