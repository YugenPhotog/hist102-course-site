# Chapter 21 — Progressivism, 1900–1917
Module Introduction

This chapter is often understood as the high point of reform in American history, when citizens, journalists, experts, and politicians worked to correct the excesses of industrial capitalism, urban growth, and political corruption. Progressivism is typically remembered as a story of improvement: cleaner food, fairer elections, safer workplaces, and a more responsive government.

The lectures in this module reveal a more complicated picture. They show Progressivism as a sustained effort to manage the disruptions of modern life by identifying threats, defining expertise, and expanding state authority into new areas of everyday experience. Reform was driven not only by rational planning but also by fear, outrage, and deeply held assumptions about who needed protection, supervision, or control.

Lecture Arc Overview

Lecture 1 — *The Jungle* and Progressive Disgust: Reform by Revelation
This lecture examines how exposure and emotional shock became engines of reform. Using *The Jungle* as a case study, it explores how disgust and public outrage created political pressure for regulation, revealing how Progressive reform often began with visceral reactions rather than abstract policy debate.

Lecture 2 — Vice, Panic, and Policing Desire: Sex, Fear, and the Progressive City
This lecture shifts attention from disgust to fear. It explores how anxieties about sexuality, gender, immigration, and urban life fueled moral panics that justified new forms of surveillance and policing. The focus is on how fear expanded state power by turning intimate behavior into a public danger.

Lecture 3 — Sex, Knowledge, and Control: The Progressive Invention of Sexual Modernity
This lecture examines how sexuality became an object of expert knowledge rather than private custom. It traces the medicalization and regulation of sex and reproduction, showing how knowledge itself functioned as a form of authority. Margaret Sanger appears as a case study within this broader transformation, illustrating both resistance to and participation in Progressive sexual governance.

How to Use This Module

The textbook provides the chronological narrative, key reforms, and political actors of the Progressive Era. The lectures provide interpretive frameworks that connect those reforms to broader themes of emotion, expertise, and state power. Together, they encourage students to think critically about how reform works, what assumptions shape it, and why Progressivism produced both protection and coercion at the same time.
