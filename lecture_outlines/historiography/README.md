# Historiography (HIST 101/102) — 3-Lecture Split

This project takes the original combined historiography slide-deck markdown file and splits it into **three separate lecture files**, aligned to a **3-day instructional arc** suitable for a community college HIST 101/102 course.

The result is a cleaner pacing structure and easier modular use in teaching (upload by day, revise by day, reuse by day).

## ✅ What We Did

### 1) Re-structured the deck into three lecture days
We reorganized the existing slide sequence into:

- **Day 1:** Terminology + Engines of Change (Conceptual Frameworks)
- **Day 2:** Ideology + Marxism + Nationalism
- **Day 3:** American Historians (Adams → Turner → Becker → Zinn)

This preserves your original flow while creating natural lecture boundaries.

### 2) Made key slide-level historical accuracy revisions
Two edits were applied directly into the new lecture files:

#### A) Renamed “Historicism” → “Determinism” (Day 1)
The original slide labeled *Historicism* was actually teaching **determinism** (forces beyond agency). To make the vocabulary historically cleaner and reduce student confusion, the slide was revised:

- Slide 13 renamed to: **Determinism**
- Determinism defined as forces beyond individual agency
- Examples retained and clarified:
  - **Marx** (material / class forces)
  - **Freud** (unconscious drives / repression shaping culture)

This avoids the historicism vocabulary problem (multiple meanings in historiography / Popper / contextualism) and aligns the slide with the lecture intent.

#### B) Softened absolutist claims in the Nationalism unit (Day 2)
The “Nationalism” slide that previously used absolute phrasing was revised so the slide text reflects nuance already present in the spoken lecture (without changing the thrust of the argument).

## Notes / Rationale

### Why split into three lecture files?
- Matches real attention limits and pacing in CC survey courses
- Supports modular use in Canvas modules
- Makes revision easier (only edit the day currently being taught)
- Separates “frameworks” from “ideology” from “historian case studies”

### Why drop “Historicism” as a core term?
Because the word means too many things depending on context:
- contextualist historical method
- Hegel/Marx teleology
- Popper’s pejorative definition

Students don’t benefit from the vocabulary fight at this level. The meaningful concept being taught is **determinism vs agency**, so the slide was renamed accordingly.

## Next Optional Enhancements
- Add three divider slides (“Day 1 / Day 2 / Day 3”) if re-merging into one deck later
- Export these MD files into:
  - PPTX (PowerPoint)
  - Reveal.js HTML deck (Canvas-ready)
  - PDF handouts for student note-taking
