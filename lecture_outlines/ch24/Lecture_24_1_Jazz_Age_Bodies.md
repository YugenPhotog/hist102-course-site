# Lecture 1 — Jazz Age Bodies: Sound, Speed, and the Camera

## Lecture Focus
This lecture introduces the 1920s through sensation and movement rather than politics. Jazz, youth culture, and photography together produce a new way of experiencing the body, time, and freedom. The core argument is that modern Americans did not just hear change — they *saw* it, and photography taught them how.

## Big Questions
- What made the 1920s feel modern to people living through it?
- How did jazz and photography reshape ideas about the body, race, and youth?
- Why did older generations experience jazz as social disorder rather than entertainment?

## I. Before the Jazz Age: Respectability and Restraint
- Victorian and Progressive-era norms emphasized discipline, sobriety, and moral control.
- Public behavior was meant to signal respectability and stability.
- Music and dance were regulated by gender expectations and racial boundaries.

## II. Jazz as a Cultural Shock
- Jazz emerges from Black communities as an improvisational, syncopated form.
- Emphasis on rhythm, experimentation, and emotional expression.
- Dancing becomes looser, faster, and more suggestive.
- Youth culture emerges as a visible social force for the first time.

## III. The Camera and the Modern Body
- Photography abandons soft focus and sentimentality.
- Sharp angles, motion blur, and candid shots mirror jazz rhythms.
- Bodies are photographed in motion rather than posed stillness.
- Nightclubs, dancers, and musicians become visual symbols of modern life.

## IV. Race, Visibility, and Unequal Freedom
- Jazz crosses racial boundaries while inequality remains intact.
- Black performers become visible to white audiences while facing segregation.
- Photography both celebrates Black creativity and commodifies it.
- Harlem becomes a cultural symbol more than a fully understood place.

## V. Why Jazz Felt Dangerous
- Jazz challenged generational authority.
- The body becomes expressive rather than controlled.
- Photography spreads these images nationally, intensifying anxiety.
- Cultural rebellion becomes portable through images and recordings.

## Closing Takeaway
The Jazz Age was not just something Americans listened to. It was something they watched, photographed, and imitated. Jazz changed how Americans moved; photography changed how they understood what they were seeing.
