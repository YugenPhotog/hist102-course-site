# Chapter 25 — Lecture 2
## Seeing the State: New Deal Photography as Democratic Governance

### Lecture Purpose
This lecture treats photography as historical argument and political tool rather than illustration. It explains how the New Deal used visual documentation to justify intervention and reshape democratic responsibility.

---

## I. Framing the Problem: Why Photography Matters

Earlier in the course:
- Civil War photography made the costs of war undeniable.
- Progressive reform photography exposed urban poverty.

The New Deal marks a shift: the federal government itself adopts the camera.

---

## II. The Farm Security Administration Photography Program

The FSA photography project aimed to:
- Make rural suffering legible
- Justify federal intervention
- Shape public empathy

Photography functioned as policy justification before legislation.

---

## III. Dorothea Lange and Moral Witness

Lange’s photographs emphasize:
- Dignity rather than spectacle
- Endurance rather than failure
- Subjects who confront the viewer

*Migrant Mother* frames suffering as a social problem demanding explanation.

---

## IV. A Curated National Vision

Different photographers contributed distinct perspectives:
- Structural poverty and distance
- Racial inequality within reform
- Class contradiction and leisure amid deprivation
- Environmental catastrophe

Together, these images form an argument about who deserves care.

---

## V. Critical Turn

These photographs are not neutral.
They are honest, selective, and purposeful.

**Key question:** Whose suffering becomes visible, and whose remains unseen?

---

## Conclusion
In the New Deal, democracy depended not on perfection, but on the act of witnessing.
