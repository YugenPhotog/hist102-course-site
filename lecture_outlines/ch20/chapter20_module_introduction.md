# Chapter 20 — Urbanization, 1890–1920
## Module Introduction

This chapter is often understood as a story of rapid city growth driven by immigration and industrialization. In the textbook, urbanization appears as a backdrop: cities expand, populations shift, and new social problems emerge as a consequence of modernization.

The lectures in this module reveal a deeper set of tensions beneath that surface narrative. Urbanization was not simply growth, but a process that forced Americans to confront questions of belonging, governance, and responsibility. Movement into cities created boundaries as much as opportunities; density produced crisis as well as innovation. Together, the lectures treat the city as a system where migration, race, environment, and reform interacted in unpredictable and often unequal ways.

## Lecture Arc Overview

### Lecture 1 — Migration and Diaspora: How the World Came to the City
This lecture reframes urbanization as a global migration story rather than a purely American one. It introduces diaspora as an interpretive framework and shows how immigrant communities formed through networks, institutions, and cultural continuity. The lecture establishes movement and migration as the foundation of urban change.

### Lecture 2 — Race, Exclusion, and the Architecture of Belonging
This lecture examines how race and law structured who could belong in American cities. Focusing on Asian migration and exclusion, it demonstrates how immigration policy became a tool for defining national identity. The lecture highlights the limits of pluralism and the role of exclusion in shaping urban society.

### Lecture 3 — Tenements, Disease, and the Birth of Public Health
This lecture shifts attention to the physical consequences of urban density. Through housing conditions, sanitation, and epidemic disease, it shows how cities became environments that shaped life and death. The lecture explains how crisis forced new forms of public responsibility and laid the groundwork for modern public health.

## How to Use This Module

The textbook provides the narrative structure and key developments of urban America. The lectures are designed to slow that narrative down and examine how systems operated beneath the surface. Together, they help students move from describing urban growth to analyzing how cities produced conflict, reform, and lasting change.
