# Module Introduction — The 1920s: Style, Sound, and Seeing Modern America

The 1920s were loud, fast, glamorous—and deeply unsettling. Americans argued about prohibition, evolution, immigration, race, and morality, but they argued about them **through culture**: music, nightlife, movies, photography, and style. This module approaches the decade from the inside out, beginning not with presidents or policies, but with how modern life *felt*.

In this era, Americans learned to experience themselves as modern people. Jazz reshaped the body and the senses. Prohibition turned morality into performance and hypocrisy into entertainment. Movies and photography taught Americans how to look, how to pose, how to desire, and how to be seen. Harlem became a center of extraordinary artistic creativity, even as segregation and inequality remained firmly in place.

Rather than treating culture as decoration layered onto “real” history, this module treats culture as a **historical engine**. Music, images, and spectacle didn’t just reflect change—they accelerated it, normalized it, and spread it nationwide. Photography and film, in particular, created a new visual world in which fame, rebellion, respectability, and danger could all be staged and circulated.

By the end of this module, students should understand the 1920s not as a carefree party that suddenly crashed in 1929, but as a decade of intense experimentation and contradiction. It was a moment when Americans learned how to sell pleasure, perform freedom, and argue about who truly belonged in modern America—often all at the same time.

This is a chapter where history should be seen, heard, and felt. If we can’t have fun with the 1920s, then history is doing something wrong.
