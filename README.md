This repository contains lecture materials, Reveal.js slide decks, and supporting content
for RCC HIST 102 (United States History Since 1877).

The course is designed for undergraduate survey instruction and emphasizes:
- historical context and chronology
- primary and secondary source analysis
- historiographical interpretation
- critical evaluation of evidence rather than memorization

Lecture content is intended to complement, not duplicate, assigned textbook readings.
The materials reflect an interpretive approach that foregrounds historical complexity,
regional variation, and scholarly debate.

Reveal.js decks are organized by chapter and topic within the `decks/` directory.
Content is revised regularly and may change between semesters.

Assessments, quizzes, answer keys, and student work are not included in this repository.
