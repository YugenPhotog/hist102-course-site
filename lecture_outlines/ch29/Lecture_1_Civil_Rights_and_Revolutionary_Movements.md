# Lecture 1 — Civil Rights and Revolutionary Movements
## Crisis of Inclusion in 1960s America

This lecture examines how the major victories of the Civil Rights Movement exposed deeper structural inequalities in American society and generated a wave of revolutionary movements demanding not just inclusion, but power.

---

### I. From Legal Equality to Structural Conflict
- Civil Rights Act (1964) and Voting Rights Act (1965) as watershed moments

- Persistent problems: housing segregation, policing, employment, education

### II. The Fragmentation of the Civil Rights Movement
- Limits of integrationism and nonviolence after 1965
- Rise of Black Power: Malcolm X, SNCC, Black Panther Party
- Emphasis on self-defense, community control, and economic justice

### III. Revolutionary Movements Beyond Black Freedom
- Chicano Movement: labor rights, cultural nationalism, education
- American Indian Movement: sovereignty, treaty rights, occupation of Alcatraz
- The New Left: SDS, participatory democracy, critique of Cold War liberalism

### IV. Shared Revolutionary Logic
- Rejection of assimilation as the primary goal
- Demand for control over institutions affecting daily life
- Shift from “rights” to “liberation”

### V. Historical Significance
- Why success intensified conflict rather than resolved it
- How these movements challenged the legitimacy of American liberalism
- Laying the groundwork for distrust of authority

### Key Takeaway
Civil rights victories expanded democracy while simultaneously revealing how incomplete American equality truly was.
