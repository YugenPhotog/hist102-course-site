# Chapter 25 Module Introduction
## The Great Depression and the New Deal

The Great Depression was not simply an economic collapse. It was a crisis of belief—belief in markets, in self-reliance, and in the promise that hard work ensured security.

This module explores how Americans responded when that belief faltered.

Rather than focusing on policy details alone, the lectures examine:
- Leadership under constraint
- The role of visibility and documentation
- The emotional and psychological dimensions of governance
- The global consequences of despair

Students will encounter the New Deal not as a completed solution, but as an improvised effort to preserve democratic faith under extreme pressure.

By the end of this module, students should be able to explain why the New Deal mattered even though it did not end the Great Depression—and why belief itself became a political problem in the 1930s.
