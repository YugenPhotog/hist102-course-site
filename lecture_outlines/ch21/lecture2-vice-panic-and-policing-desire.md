# Chapter 21, Lecture 2 — Vice, Panic, and Policing Desire: Sex, Fear, and the Progressive City

## Opening Frame: From Disgust to Fear
Lecture 1 examined how **disgust** mobilized Progressive reform by turning hidden industrial systems into personal bodily threats.  
This lecture shifts emotional register.

If disgust produced regulation, **fear produced surveillance**.

This lecture explores how anxieties about sex, gender, immigration, and urban anonymity fueled a different kind of Progressive reform—one oriented less toward protection and more toward **control**.

Interpretive framing:
The Progressive Era did not simply repress sexuality. It made sex a *public danger* that justified new forms of state power.

---

## Purpose of the Lecture
This lecture examines the “white-slave panic” and the Mann Act as windows into how Progressives used **moral fear** to expand policing authority, redefine consent, and regulate movement.

The focus is not on sensational stories themselves, but on:
- why those stories were believable
- what kinds of power they enabled
- and what they reveal about Progressive assumptions regarding women, immigrants, race, and sexuality

The lecture prioritizes interpretation over narrative detail.

## I. Why Sex Became a Public Crisis
Begin with context rather than scandal.

Several structural changes converged in the early 20th century:
- young women working outside the home
- delayed marriage
- urban anonymity
- immigrant neighborhoods outside older moral oversight
- commercial leisure culture (dance halls, theaters, amusement parks)

Sex no longer appeared confined to family or church regulation.

Interpretive claim:
Progressives increasingly understood sexual behavior as a **threat to social order**, not merely a moral failing.

This reframing transformed sex into a legitimate object of governance.

---

## II. The White-Slave Panic as Cultural Narrative
The “white-slave” panic functioned less as accurate description and more as **moral storytelling**.

Core elements of the narrative:
- innocent girls
- predatory men
- dangerous cities
- corrupt vice networks
- helpless families

Interpretive emphasis:
These stories compressed multiple anxieties into a single figure—the endangered white woman.

They expressed fears about:
- immigration
- class mobility
- female independence
- racial mixing
- loss of parental control

The panic was less about prostitution itself than about **who controlled women’s bodies and movement**.

---

## III. Protection vs. Agency: The Progressive Dilemma
Progressives framed intervention as protection.

But this framing carried assumptions:
- women were vulnerable rather than agentic
- sexual danger came from outside, not within social norms
- working-class women required supervision

This logic blurred distinctions between:
- coercion and consent
- protection and punishment
- rescue and control

Interpretive point:
Once sexuality was framed as inherently dangerous, women’s autonomy itself became suspect.

---

## IV. The Mann Act (1910): Fear Becomes Federal Law
The Mann Act criminalized transporting women across state lines for “immoral purposes.”

Interpretive focus:
The law’s power lay in its **ambiguity**.

“Immoral purposes” was intentionally undefined.

This allowed:
- federal jurisdiction over intimate life
- prosecution without evidence of force
- policing of consensual relationships

The law marked a major shift:
Sexual morality became a matter of **national governance**, not local custom.

---

## V. Enforcement and Racial Power
Although justified as anti-trafficking legislation, enforcement patterns reveal deeper priorities.

The Mann Act was disproportionately used against:
- interracial couples
- Black men with white partners
- working-class men
- public figures who violated sexual norms

Interpretive claim:
The law functioned as a tool for enforcing racial and sexual boundaries under the guise of moral reform.

This highlights a recurring Progressive pattern:
State power expanded most aggressively where social anxieties were greatest.

---

## VI. Surveillance, Knowledge, and the Modern State
The panic legitimized new techniques of governance:
- vice commissions
- undercover policing
- moral courts
- social workers as investigators
- recordkeeping on sexual behavior

Interpretive synthesis:
Progressive reform often replaced informal moral authority with **bureaucratic oversight**.

Sex became:
- observable
- categorizable
- punishable

This lecture prepares students to understand how sexuality soon became a subject of expert knowledge rather than pure moral judgment.

---

## VII. Limits and Consequences
Despite expansive policing:
- prostitution did not disappear
- exploitation persisted
- women bore the greatest costs of enforcement

Interpretive question to pose:
What happens when reform defines danger so broadly that normal human behavior becomes suspect?

This question leads directly into the next lecture.

---

## Concluding Insight (Instructor Emphasis)
The white-slave panic and Mann Act reveal Progressivism’s coercive edge.

Fear—not evidence—often determined policy scope.
Protection frequently justified punishment.
Sexual regulation expanded state authority into the most intimate domains of life.

This lecture shows how moral panic became a **technology of governance**.
