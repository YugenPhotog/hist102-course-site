# Chapter 26 — Module Introduction
## World War II: Fascism, Total War, and American Power

This module examines World War II not simply as a military conflict, but as a **struggle over political systems, moral legitimacy, and the future of modern power**. Rather than tracing every battle or campaign, the lectures focus on *why the war happened, what it demanded of democratic societies, and how it reshaped the United States*.

At the center of this chapter is a core argument:  
World War II was a global fight against **expansionist fascism**—an ideology that required conquest, racial hierarchy, and permanent war in order to survive.

Understanding fascism as an ideology helps explain:
- why aggression was not accidental or negotiable
- why appeasement failed
- why the war became total in scope
- and why the United States ultimately mobilized on an unprecedented scale

The module then turns inward, examining how total war transformed American life at home. Wartime mobilization expanded federal power, reshaped labor and gender roles, and exposed the limits of American democracy through policies such as the internment of Japanese Americans. These developments reveal a central tension of the war: **the United States fought fascism abroad while suspending liberal principles at home**.

The module also confronts a major gap in student knowledge by examining fascist atrocities in both Europe and Asia—not as a catalog of horrors, but as policies that clarified what was at stake in the conflict and shaped American wartime thinking. Students will consider what Americans knew during the war, how that knowledge was framed, and how it influenced the moral meaning later attached to World War II as “the good war.”

Finally, the module concludes with the atomic bomb and Japan’s surrender. Rather than treating the bomb as a standalone moral debate, the lectures situate it within the logic of total war and the emergence of the United States as a global superpower. Victory over fascism ends the war, but it also inaugurates the nuclear age and a new set of global responsibilities.

By the end of this module, students should be able to explain:
- fascism as an expansionist modern ideology
- why World War II became a total war
- how the war reshaped American democracy and state power
- and how victory produced new moral, political, and global dilemmas

This chapter sets up the transition to the postwar world, where questions of accountability, human rights, occupation, and Cold War rivalry will dominate American history after 1945.
