# Lecture 1 — Television Changes Everything  
**Chapter 28: America at Midcentury, 1953–1963**

## Central Question
How did television fundamentally change the way Americans experienced politics, leadership, and national crisis?

## Framing Argument
Television did not make politics shallow.  
It made politics *visible*.

By the late 1950s, Americans were no longer primarily reading politics or hearing it on the radio. They were watching it. This altered expectations of leadership, credibility, emotion, and authority—and permanently reshaped democratic life.
